During 2011_IWISE I began playing with Visbeck-type plots, which
required different output. Additionally, based on processing a single
in-ice station, I now think that there may be beam-velocity bias. I am
not sure, however, because while multiplying the beam velocities with a
factor of 1.03 appears to take care of the down-/up-cast bias, there is
still a correlation between the residuals and CTD_w. In any case, I
changed the semantics of the old -x option, that was supposed to
correct for package-motion effects and removed the -p option. I also
removed the old -d option that dumped the bins into individual files,
and replaced it with a "residual diagnostics" output (for the
Visbeck-type plots). All the old code is left in place, commented out. 
I soon realized that the main profile output can be easily and exactly
reconstructed from the "residual diagnostic output" using bindata, i.e.
it seems more useful to have the diagnostic output become the default.
To make the code cleaner, I want to remove all the commented-out stuff.
Therefore I saved the current version so I can return to it if needed.
