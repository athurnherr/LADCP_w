This is the version arrived at after dicking around a lot with trying
to implement a surface-wave correction based on unfiltered and filtered
CTD package velocity. After my realization that the correction depends
very strongly on the package size (because almost no correction is
required for the P403 data, which were taken with a very small rosette)
and some thought I now think that the correction should be done in terms
of CTD acceleration and, possibly, separately for
accelerating/decelerating motion. I decided to save the current version
just in case.
