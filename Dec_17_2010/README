This version was copied from ANTS. It is a slightly extended version
that was used for the IEEE abstract. It works for the P403 YOYO, most
stations of the DIMES US2 Drake-passage section, and several of the
early DIMES UK2 grid stations.

This version attempts to determine the optimal lag for each LADCP
ensemble, allowing only a moderate number of time jumps. This behavior
is intended to allow processing of CTD files with dropped records. The
problem is that the data near the surface are noisy and can throw the
lagging algorithm off whack. Sometimes the problem can be solved by
slightly adjusting the initial guess lag. Sometimes the problem can be
solved by using -m to limit the allowed magnitude of the vertical
velocities. Overall, I think that the code is buggy. It could probably
be improved by skipping early CTD time jumps if they are too large to be
realistic. However, after having applied this version to several
different data sets, it appears that skipped CTD records are not all
that common. Therefore, I will continue development with a simpler
version that does not allow for skipped CTD records.
