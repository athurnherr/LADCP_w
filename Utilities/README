=PostProcess.sh=

At the end of LADCP_w_ocean, the external program [PostProcess.sh] is
called if it is found in the search path and its executable bit is set.
This program can be used, for example, to correct the bounding boxes of
the PostScript files, etc. The example provided here is for
illustration purposes only. It uses a non-public utility called "tile"
to combine all processing plots on a single page.



=Hook-Utilities=

There are hooks in the LADCP_w code that allow additional routines to
be called for non-standard processing. In order to enable them, the
routines have to be included, e.g. by adding the following statement to
the relevant ProcessingParams file:

	require "$WCALC/Utilities/post_merge_TL_check.pl";


[post_merge_TL_check.pl]	check time lagging (creates .TLcheck files)
[post_merge_dwdz_filt.pl]	filter ensembles with large |dw/dz|
